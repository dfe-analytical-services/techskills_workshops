# Introduction

We've prepared this walkthrough guide for statistics publication teams as an introduction to the ways in which coding in R can be used for Reproducible Analystical Pipelines (RAPs), creating functions for typical tasks that teams may come across. The guide is intended to be step-by-step, building up from the very basics. The plan is to work through this in groups of 3-ish with access to experienced R users for support. If it starts too basic for your level, then just go through at your own/your group’s pace as you see fit. By no means can we cover everything in this walkthrough, so please see it as a prompt to ask follow-up questions as you’re working through on anything related to R, RAP and coding in general.

## What is a RAP?

RAP stands for Reproducible Analytical Pipeline. The full words still hide the true meaning behind buzzwords and jargon though. What it actually means is using automation to our advantage when analysing data, and this is as simple as writing code such as an R script that we can click a button to execute and do the job for us. 

Using R (the coding language) really helps us to put the R in RAP ('reproducible'). Ask yourself, if someone else picked up your work, could they easily reproduce your exact outputs? And when the time comes around to update your analysis with new data, how easy is it for you to reproduce the analysis you need? In an ideal RAP, it would be as simple as plugging the new data in and clicking 'go', with no need to manually scroll through multiple scripts updating the year in every file name or the variable name that's changed from using _ to -. 

# Pre-workshop requirements

## Technical requirements

First of all, make sure to bring your laptop. This is going to be interactive and require you to do some coding.

Preferably before coming along, you'll need to go through the following list of things you'll need to make sure are set up on your DfE laptop:

* Set up an Azure Dev Ops Basic account (not a Stakeholder account) at the DfE Service Portal;
Either:

* Install git on your laptop: [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads);
* Install R-Studio on your machine: Download **R for Windows (x64)** and **RStudio** from the Software Centre on your DfE laptop.

Or:

* If you're on EDAP and used to using R/R-Studio and/or git on there, feel free to just use that.

You'll also need to make sure that git is set up in the git/SVN pane of global options in R-Studio (found in the Tools drop down menu). Make sure the path to your git executable is entered in the git path box and git should automatically be integrated with R-Studio. 

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='64%', fig.cap='Enter the path to your git executable in the git path option box'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/gitdemo/gitdemo-gitRstudio-settings.png')
```

Once you open a repository, you'll get an extra panel, named 'git', in the top right pane of R-Studio and you'll also be able to use git in the 'Terminal' tab at the bottom left (in the same place as the R console). 

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='56%', fig.cap='The `git BASH` terminal in R-Studio'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/gitdemo/gitdemo-gitRstudio-NewTerminal.png')
```

A useful thing here if you want to use git commands in the terminal is to switch the terminal from the default Windows Command Prompt to `git BASH`. You can do this in the Terminal tab of R-Studio's global options - just select `git BASH` from the 'New terminal opens with' pull down menu. Click apply and then select the Terminal tab (next to the Console tab), click 'Terminal 1' and then select 'New terminal' from the drop down menu. You should see something similar to the terminal screenshot.

## Working in teams

To get the most out of git and Dev Ops, you're going to need to work in teams. We're aiming for groups of 3. Some of the tasks we'll work through will require just one of your team to perform, whilst others will require all of your team to perform them. If it's not clear then ask and most importantly, communicate with each other about what you're doing.

To help illustrate the challenges and benefits of git and Dev Ops and how to work collectively within the same space, all the groups will be working within the same repository. Each group will have their own working branch (already created) with the naming format `workshop_group_N`:

  * `workshop_group_1`
  * `workshop_group_2`
  * ...

We'll need to prefix branches and tasks within the repository with `grN_` and group N respectively (again switching the `N` for your group number). 

By the end, you should get a good idea of how to utilize R for RAP processes, as well as how to collaborate using git!

# Getting started ...

Now we will begin the tasks and group work. First, everyone open the R project that 


## Summary

We've looked through a lot of the basics in this section, covering adding/staging, committing, pushing/pulling between remote and local repos, merging and pull requests. These are all the main concepts you need to use git. 

We've also tried to cover doing all this through a mixture of RStudio, git BASH and GitHub (and as we've said Azure Dev Ops offers similar functionality to GitHub). Most common processes can be done multiple ways and there's not necessarily a single right method to follow, just whichever makes most sense in your situation.

Just a quick final note on why it's useful to be familiar with git `BASH`. Whilst most of the basic git functionality can be accessed via the RStudio panel or GitHub/Dev Ops, there are some things that are best achieved through BASH. In particular, if you have a file in your repo that you need to remove entirely, this pretty much requires someone to use commands via git BASH.


| Process       | git BASH                          | RStudio git panel                               |
|---------------|------------------------------|:------------------------:|
| Create branch | `git checkout -b branch_name` |  \includegraphics{"images/gitdemo/gitdemo-RStudio-gitToolbarCreateBranch.png"} |
| Switch branch  | `git checkout branch_name` | \includegraphics{"images/gitdemo/gitdemo-RStudio-gitToolbarSwitchBranch.png"} |
| Merge branch   | `git merge branch_name`  | N/A - use GitHub/Dev Ops |

# Troubleshooting

## renv

If `renv::restore()` causes issues, then one of your team should try `renv::init()` and select option 2 to restart renv. Then do a add/commit/push cycle and get the other team members to do a pull and then try running `renv::restore()` again on their local clones of the repo.

## Datafiles commit-hooks/`.gitignore`

To help teams keep on top of avoiding any accidental publishing of unpublished data, we've added in some code around commits that checks through any data files in the repo and checks them against a logfile and the .gitignore file. Any files listed in .gitignore will not be included in commits and therefore won't be sent to the remote repo as part of any push.

## merge conflicts

Merge commits happen when two branches have conflicting changes that have been made concurrently. `git` can usually figure out how to prioritise changes based on the commit history, but if changes have happened at the same time to the same bit of code across different branches, then it will need to get your input on how to prioritise the changes.

The easiest way to go through how to deal with merge conflicts is by discussing with an example, so ask us in the workshop if and when you hit a merge conflict.

Briefly though, when there's a merge conflict, git will add some text to the file containing the conflict along the following lines:

```
<<<<<<<<<<< branch_1
code 
on 
branch 
1
===========
conflicting code on branch 2
>>>>>>>>>>> branch_2

```

Effectively as the user, you need to decide which bit of code is the right bit to keep and then delete anything you don't want to keep as well as the tag-lines that git has added in. So for example, you should be left with something along the lines of:

```
code 
on 
branch 
1

```

Once you've cleared up all merge conflicts in the branch that you're working on, then perform another add/commit cycle and thay should clear out the conflict from the branch that you're working on and you'll be able to continue with the intended merge/PR.
