# Introduction

We've prepared this walkthrough guide for statistics publication teams as an introduction to the ways in which coding in R can be used for Reproducible Analystical Pipelines (RAPs), creating functions for typical tasks that teams may come across. The guide is intended to be step-by-step, building up from the very basics. The plan is to work through this in groups of 3-ish with access to experienced R users for support. If it starts too basic for your level, then just go through at your own/your group’s pace as you see fit. By no means can we cover everything in this walkthrough, so please see it as a prompt to ask follow-up questions as you’re working through on anything related to R, RAP and coding in general.

## What is a RAP?

RAP stands for Reproducible Analytical Pipeline. The full words still hide the true meaning behind buzzwords and jargon though. What it actually means is using automation to our advantage when analysing data, and this is as simple as writing code such as an R script that we can click a button to execute and do the job for us. 

Using R (the coding language) really helps us to put the R in RAP ('reproducible'). Ask yourself, if someone else picked up your work, could they easily reproduce your exact outputs? And when the time comes around to update your analysis with new data, how easy is it for you to reproduce the analysis you need? In an ideal RAP, it would be as simple as plugging the new data in and clicking 'go', with no need to manually scroll through multiple scripts updating the year in every file name or the variable name that's changed from using _ to -. 

## What is R/R Studio?

R is a coding language. There are many different languages of code, some others include SQL, python, JavaScript and many more. They all have benefits, and the difference is often the syntax used (literally like learning new languages!). R is open-source, meaning it is free, anyone can use it and anyone can contribute to developing new ‘packages’.

* A *package* is a set of functions someone else has written and tied together in a nice neat bow, ready for you to use! You simply install the package, and then you have all of the functions available. 

* A *function* is a chunk of code that has been grouped together, given a name, and often has ‘place holders’ you can change, such that you can use that name to run that code, and apply it to different data. 
(for example, mean(x) is a function that calculates the arithmetic mean of x. You replace x with any numeric data.)

R studio is a programme that enables us to code in the R coding language, while also providing a visual and interactive interface. It has useful areas and windows that enable you to see what tables you have loaded, charts you have created, Git user interface, file explorer, help windows and many more!
Normally you will see the screen split into 3 or 4 windows:


```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.cap='R studio panels'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/RforRAP/R-studio-panels.png')
```

* Top left - Source pane. Open and view your code scripts, tables, data sets, functions. 

* top right - Environment/History/Connections/Git (if you have it). The environment shows you what data, functions, objects etc you have.

* Bottom left - Console. Shows what you have run, and you can type and run commands directly into the console. 

* Bottom right - File explorer/plots/packages/Viewer. 

# Pre-workshop requirements

## Technical requirements

First of all, make sure to bring your laptop. This is going to be interactive and require you to do some coding.

Preferably before coming along, you'll need to go through the following list of things you'll need to make sure are set up on your DfE laptop:

* Set up an Azure Dev Ops Basic account (not a Stakeholder account) at the DfE Service Portal;
Either:

* Install git on your laptop: [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads);
* Install R-Studio on your machine: Download **R for Windows (x64)** and **RStudio** from the Software Centre on your DfE laptop.

Or:

* If you're on EDAP and used to using R/R-Studio and/or git on there, feel free to just use that.

You'll also need to make sure that git is set up in the git/SVN pane of global options in R-Studio (found in the Tools drop down menu). Make sure the path to your git executable is entered in the git path box and git should automatically be integrated with R-Studio. 

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='64%', fig.cap='Enter the path to your git executable in the git path option box'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/gitdemo/gitdemo-gitRstudio-settings.png')
```

Once you open a repository, you'll get an extra panel, named 'git', in the top right pane of R-Studio and you'll also be able to use git in the 'Terminal' tab at the bottom left (in the same place as the R console). 

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='56%', fig.cap='The `git BASH` terminal in R-Studio'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/gitdemo/gitdemo-gitRstudio-NewTerminal.png')
```

A useful thing here if you want to use git commands in the terminal is to switch the terminal from the default Windows Command Prompt to `git BASH`. You can do this in the Terminal tab of R-Studio's global options - just select `git BASH` from the 'New terminal opens with' pull down menu. Click apply and then select the Terminal tab (next to the Console tab), click 'Terminal 1' and then select 'New terminal' from the drop down menu. You should see something similar to the terminal screenshot.

## Working in teams

To get the most out of git and Dev Ops, you're going to need to work in teams. We're aiming for groups of 3. Some of the tasks we'll work through will require just one of your team to perform, whilst others will require all of your team to perform them. If it's not clear then ask and most importantly, communicate with each other about what you're doing.

To help illustrate the challenges and benefits of git and Dev Ops and how to work collectively within the same space, all the groups will be working within the same repository. Each group will have their own working branch (already created) with the naming format `workshop_group_N`:

  * `workshop_group_1`
  * `workshop_group_2`
  * ...

We'll need to prefix branches and tasks within the repository with `grN_` and group N respectively (again switching the `N` for your group number). 

By the end, you should get a good idea of how to utilize R for RAP processes, as well as how to collaborate using git!

\newpage

# Getting started ...

Now we will begin the tasks and group work. First, everyone **open up R studio.**

# Creating a project 

When creating RAP processes, it's key that your code is reusable, transparent, and well documented, such that it is future-proofed for any future team members. Therefore, first, we will show you how to create an R project. Using an R project ensures that all of the files in the project folder (scripts, plots, notes, etc.) can all be referenced relative to the **.Rproj file** location. Basically, it removes the need to set and get your working directory, and removes the need to use long & complete file paths. Instead, you essentially start any file path from the location of the .Rproj file! *For example*, if you have a code.R code script, and a data.csv file in a project folder that has been set up as an R project, and you want to read the .csv in the R script, you don't need the entire file path of the csv (which probably starts C:/... and can get very long), just the file path relative to the *.Rproj file* which in this case would simply be 'data.csv'.

If you're struggling to grasp that, that's okay, we will create a project and see this in action today. To create a new project, in R studio, go to **File > New Project > New directory > New Project**. Give your project a name and choose where about in your files you would like the project to be saved. Click 'Create project'. We aren't going to discuss using Git or version control today, but if you are using these in a project, make sure you **do not** save the project folder in OneDrive (this is because OneDrive has it's own version-control system, and trying to use Git within that can cause complications and errors). 


## Using renv

Renv (short for R environment) is a package in R that helps you to keep a record of which packages your project uses, and what version of each package it should use. Using renv in your R project means that anybody in the future (including your future self) who comes back to this project, can immediately get all of the required packages. First you need to install the renv package by running `install.packages('renv')` in the console. 

Once that has installed, you can run the functions from this package. You can also see what packages are installed by navigating to the 'Packages' tab in the bottom right window - renv should have appeared in here now.

When using functions from packages, you can either type `the package name::the function name` or just the function name on its own. However, problems can arise if two packages have a function with the same name, so using the package name and colons is safer. 

To activate renv, run `renv::activate()` in the console. If you navigate back to the files tab in the bottom left and look in your project folder, you should see some renv-related files have appeared, including a *renv.lock* file. The renv.lock file is the file that records all of your project's packages and their versions. If you click on the renv.lock file it will open for you to view in the top left. 

Each time you add or remove packages, or update the package versions, you should run `renv::snapshot()` to take a snapshot of the current state of your library. If you ever get a new device, or someone else wants to view your project, they simply need to run `renv::restore()` to restore the package library on their device to match the packages needed in the project. 

# Your initial script

Now that we have your project created and renv activated, we can create our first code script. Open a new R script file by selecting **File > New File > R script**. 

## Comments and headings

Comments in code are some of the most useful documentation you can use, and are crucial for RAP! You should start your script with comments that provide important information such as what this code script contains and what it is for - basically anything you think a new person would need to know in order to understand and run the code effectively. You add comments in R scripts by starting the line with a **hash symbol, #**. Any line that starts with a hash symbol will be treated as a comment rather than code, and so will not be 'run'. You can also add comments to the end of lines of code by including the hash symbol half-way through a line - everything after the # will be treated as a comment, and everything before will be treated as code. If you have multiple lines of comments you wish to add, you can type them out, highlight them and use `ctrl+shift+C` to 'comment out' all of the highlighted lines. 

Add some comments to the beginning of your script now - include your name, the date, and a short description that explains that this is the first script, and will include library calls as well as loading data and any functions that will be used in future.

Your first script should definitely include the 'library-calls' for all of the packages you will need. This basically means loading any packages you need at the beginning, before running any future code that requires them. We load/call packages by using the `library()` function.

Our first steps only require two packages, 'readr' and 'dplyr'. You can either install these by typing `install.packages('readr')` and `install.packages('dplyr')` one at a time in the console, or you can install both packages at once by running `install.packages(c('readr', 'dplyr'))`. Then, remember to take a `renv::snapshot()`! 

Now, below your initial comments, we will add the library calls to the script. First, we should add a section header! Section headers are yet again another form of good documentation, and and extremely helpful when navigating around scripts of code! To add a section header, we can use the keyboard shortcut `ctrl+shift+R`. In the pop-up window, give the first section the header 'Load in packages'. Then click okay and you should see the header has appeared in your code. In the bottom left of the code window, you should see the section header has appeared, and if you click on the name you can navigate to other sections when you have built up your script further. 

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.cap='R Studio section headers navigation'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/RforRAP/section_headers.png')
```

Another way to view and navigate between all of the sections in a script is to use the keyboard shortcut `ctrl+shift+O` to open the sections in a small panel on the right of your script.

**Throughout this workshop, make sure to add comments at every step so you know what each code snippet is doing, and why!**

## Adding and running code

Now, below the heading on a new line, add `library(readr)`, then on a new line add `library(dplyr)`. In R, each new line represents a new code command. You don't need to use a semi-colon or any other punctuation to separate commands other than just starting a new line, and you cannot have two commands on the same line. Therefore, since the two library calls are two distinct commands because they load different packages, they each need to be on a new line. 

To actually run code that you have saved in a script file, there are a few options. Firstly, there are buttons you can use to the top right of the script file's window. 

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.cap='R Studio run and source buttons'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/RforRAP/run_buttons.png')
```

Button 1 in the above image (the 'run' button) will run either all *highlighted* code, or, if no lines are highlighted it will run the line or snippet where your cursor is located (in the above image, you can see the faint cursor line at the end of line 4, so clicking run would run line 4 in this instance). Another way to do this is to use the 'run' keyboard shortcut - `ctrl + Enter`. This works in the same way and will either run all highlighted lines, or the snippet where the cursor is located.

Button 2 (the 'Source' button) will run the entire script from the first to the last line in one go! This is the same as running `Source("script_name.R")` in the console. `Source(...)` is particularly useful in RAPs, as one of the baseline expectations for statistics publication pipelines is that you have one script that runs every single step of the process - sourcing scripts one by one in the correct order in a 'run_pipeline' script (with comments!) is great way to do this while keeping it tidy and clear!

Highlight the lines you have just added to the script and run them either using the button or the keyboard shortcut. Now we have the packages we need to load in some data. 

## Loading in the data

There are multiple ways to load data into R. Today we will cover two common ways we see analysts use;

1. Reading in a **CSV** file,

2. Loading data in directly from **SQL** servers.

Before using either method to load in the data, we should add a new section header! Use the guidance above to add a new section header called 'Load in the data'. 

### Reading in CSVs

We already installed the `readr` package, which contains the functions we need to read CSVs into R. In R, i is best practice to name our objects (tables, data sets, etc) so that you can use that name to reference the objects you need. This means that while the code `readr::read_csv(insert_filename/filepath_here)` is the function that reads in a given csv, we should write it in the below format:

`chosen_name <- readr::read_csv(insert_filename/filepath_here)`

Then, if you navigate to the 'environment' window in the top right of the screen, you should see an object has appeared with your chosen name under the heading 'Data'. If you click the blue circle with the white arrow inside, it will expand to show you information about the data you've uploaded, including the name of every column/variable, and the format of each column (i.e. chr for character, num for numeric). If you click the name of the object, it will open in the viewer in the top left so that you can look at the table. This is the same as typing `View(name_of_data)` in the console. 

### Reading in from SQL

In order to read the data in from SQL we need to install the relevant packagesand connect to the SQL database. Firstly, we need to install the `odbc` and `DBI` packages. Try to use the above guidance to;

a. Install the `odbc` and `DBI` packages,

b. Add the library calls to the correct section of the initial script,

c. Take a snapshot to update the renv.lock file.

Once you have complete the above steps, we can use the new packages to connect to the secure SQL database. We use the following code (inserting the server and database we require) to create an object with the connection. You can call it anything, but common practice is to call this connection 'con':

```
# Connect to SQL database
con <- DBI::dbConnect(odbc::odbc(),
    Driver = "{SQL Server Native Client 17.0}",
    Server = "...",
    Database = "...",
    Trusted_connection = "Yes"
  )
```

[Note that this code will only work for you if you have access to the specified server and database, so only users with existing access can use this code in R to connect and pull in data! If someone without access tried to run this code, they would get an error in the R console.]

Now that we have the connection stored and named, we can use it to read in a table from the database into R. There are multiple ways to do this - in this workshop we will cover two of them. 

1. Use `tbl(con, table_name)`,

2. Use `sqlQuery(con, "SELECT * FROM [table_name];")`.

Option one above is a very concise and tidy way, which (as long as you're add descriptive comments) will make your code easy to read and understand. Option two is slightly longer, however, it allows you to run SQL queries in R, so if you have previous experience with SQL you may find this useful. You can edit and customise the SQL query, meaning you have the option of selecting specific columns and filtering at this stage, rather than reading in the entire table. Just ensure that you write the table_name exactly how you would in SQL (including schemas, )

Whichever option you choose, you need to choose what name you would like this object to have in R once the table is read in. It is best practice to make object names descriptive but concise. This means describing what the table contains, but not including unnecessary and repetitive words such as 'table' in the name. The data we are using today contains data on the characteristics and grades of some students, so we might choose to call the table 'students'. We assign the table this name by using the `<-` symbols, so the full snippet should look something like this: 

```
# Read in student data from SQL
students <- tbl(con, table_name)
```

Add this under an appropriate heading/comment to your initial script. 
Then, if you navigate to the 'environment' window in the top right of the screen, you should see an object has appeared with your chosen name under the heading 'Data'. If you click the blue circle with the white arrow inside, it will expand to show you information about the data you've uploaded, including the name of every column/variable, and the format of each column (i.e. chr for character, num for numeric). If you click the name of the object, it will open in the viewer in the top left so that you can look at the table. This is the same as typing `View(name_of_data)` in the console. 

# Manupilating data

Once you have pulled data into R studio, it is likely you want to manipulate it in some way. In this workshop, we have pulled in data that contains one line per student, so one common task is to aggregate data, and get it in the correct tidy format for EES. 

## Aggregate data

Aggregating data is a common task analysts face. In the data we have loaded into R studio in this workshop, there is a line per student, containing that students characteristics and grades. We want to aggregate this by certain characteristics and get the average grade for each aggregated group. Firstly, it's possible that we might want to filter on certain variables so that we only include certain students in our data. 

To **filter** data, we can simply use the `filter()` function from the `dplyr` package, which we have already installed and loaded. Here we will also introduce the **pipe** symbol - `%>%`. 

In our environment, we should see the data we have loaded in with the name we gave it - 'students'. If we want to filter this, we would do so in the following format:

```
students %>%
filter()
```

# Troubleshooting

## renv

If `renv::restore()` causes issues, then one of your team should try `renv::init()` and select option 2 to restart renv. Then do a add/commit/push cycle and get the other team members to do a pull and then try running `renv::restore()` again on their local clones of the repo.

## Datafiles commit-hooks/`.gitignore`

To help teams keep on top of avoiding any accidental publishing of unpublished data, we've added in some code around commits that checks through any data files in the repo and checks them against a logfile and the .gitignore file. Any files listed in .gitignore will not be included in commits and therefore won't be sent to the remote repo as part of any push.

## merge conflicts

Merge commits happen when two branches have conflicting changes that have been made concurrently. `git` can usually figure out how to prioritise changes based on the commit history, but if changes have happened at the same time to the same bit of code across different branches, then it will need to get your input on how to prioritise the changes.

The easiest way to go through how to deal with merge conflicts is by discussing with an example, so ask us in the workshop if and when you hit a merge conflict.

Briefly though, when there's a merge conflict, git will add some text to the file containing the conflict along the following lines:

```
<<<<<<<<<<< branch_1
code 
on 
branch 
1
===========
conflicting code on branch 2
>>>>>>>>>>> branch_2

```

Effectively as the user, you need to decide which bit of code is the right bit to keep and then delete anything you don't want to keep as well as the tag-lines that git has added in. So for example, you should be left with something along the lines of:

```
code 
on 
branch 
1

```

Once you've cleared up all merge conflicts in the branch that you're working on, then perform another add/commit cycle and thay should clear out the conflict from the branch that you're working on and you'll be able to continue with the intended merge/PR.
